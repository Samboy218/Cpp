To compile the 'stego.cpp'
There is an included makefile to help compiling
If that is not working, you can manually compile. Use the '-std=c++11' flag
then run the program from the command line and follow the on-screen prompts.
Thanks for using the program!

lodepng.cpp and lodepng.h are not mine, They are the work of Lode Vandevenne, the source can be found here: lodev.org/lodepng/ or https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng
